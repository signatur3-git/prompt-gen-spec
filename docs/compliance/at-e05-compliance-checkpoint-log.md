# AT-E05 compliance checkpoint log

The AT-E05 log records every validator run initiated through the Authoring Tool. It acts as the canonical register that ties submission identifiers to evidence artefacts captured in Milestone M3 templates.

## Log fields

| Field | Description | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Submission ID | Unique identifier generated by the Authoring Tool when a package enters validation. | Authoring Tool event stream |
| Package name | Canonical package slug under review. | Submission manifest |
| Tier | Compliance tier evaluated for the submission (Baseline, Advanced, Premium). | Validator intake form |
| Validator lead | Individual responsible for the validation run. | Validator roster |
| Sanity check bundle | Reference to the sanity-check configuration (e.g., `SC-01-2024-05`). | Sanity check inventory |
| Deterministic seed | Seed captured from the validator CLI for reproducibility. | Validator CLI output |
| Evidence bundle | Comma-separated list of linked evidence files (checklists, worksheets, monitoring exports). | Uploaded attachments |
| Status | `Pass`, `Fail`, or `Variance` depending on validation outcome. | Validator sign-off |
| Sign-off timestamp | UTC timestamp for validator lead approval. | Validator CLI / manual entry |

## Recording procedure

1. **Create entry:** The Authoring Tool automatically emits a draft row when a submission enters validation. The validator lead confirms the submission details and tier within one business day.
2. **Attach evidence:** As each checklist or worksheet section is completed, record the evidence filename in the Evidence bundle column (e.g., `CV-BAS-01-20240519.md`).
3. **Capture approvals:** Upon completing the run, mark the status, capture the sign-off timestamp, and reference the compliance liaison notified of the outcome.
4. **Escalate variances:** If the status is `Variance`, tag the compliance lead in the project channel and open a corrective-action issue in the repository referencing this log entry.

> **Retention requirement:** Maintain AT-E05 entries and attachments for at least 30 days (Baseline control) and archive quarterly snapshots for Premium tier customers.
