# Documentation Inventory & Gap Analysis

This inventory catalogs the current documentation assets that contribute to the RPG v1.0.0.rc1 Request for Proposal. Each entry identifies how the asset maps to RFP sections, ownership expectations, and outstanding gaps to reach milestone M0 acceptance criteria. Documents located inside the `source-of-truth` directory are treated as immutable reference material and are not included in the change backlog.

## Inventory Snapshot

| Document | Current Status | Related RFP Sections | Notes & Gaps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/index.md` | Draft landing page referencing core documentation areas. | §1 Executive Summary, §2 Program Background | Requires alignment with finalized project plan milestones once approved. |
| `docs/architecture/components.md` | Initial description of major system components. | §2 Program Background, §3 Documentation Deliverables Scope, §4–§11 component overviews | Needs validation against latest architecture source-of-truth and addition of interface diagrams. |
| `docs/architecture/context-interactions.md` | Describes interaction flows between components. | §4 Authoring Tool, §6 Validator, §8 Rendering Engine | Update terminology to match glossary refresh (M1 dependency). |
| `docs/architecture/template-syntax.md` | Covers template language expectations. | §8 Rendering Engine, §9 Compliance & Evidence | Expand examples and include compliance checkpoints. |
| `docs/glossary.md` | Existing terminology list. | §2 Program Background, Appendix A | Requires synchronization with RFC 0001 terms and new RFP vocabulary. |
| `docs/operations/index.md` | Placeholder for operational guides. | §3 Documentation Scope, §13 Submission Instructions | Needs outline fleshed out for deployment and maintenance procedures. |
| `docs/rfc/0001-composite-random-prompt-generator.md` | Baseline RFC describing RPG. | §2 Program Background, §12 Compliance Framework | Cross-reference updates required to map clauses to compliance tiers (planned for M1/M3). |
| `docs/sanity-checks/index.md` & `docs/sanity-checks/example-sentences.md` | Sample validation checks. | §12 Compliance Framework, Appendix C | Requires normalization of formatting and linkage to compliance evidence templates. |
| `docs/project-management/milestones.md` | Roadmap defining documentation milestones. | §1 Executive Summary, §3 Documentation Scope | Needs progress tracking metadata (status, owners) appended per milestone. |
| `docs/project-management/rfp-outline.md` | Canonical RFP outline. | Entire RFP structure | Keep synchronized with deliverable drafts; identify missing sections as drafts progress. |
| `source-of-truth/*.md` (reference only) | Authoritative architectural descriptions. | §2 Program Background, §4–§11 | Must remain unchanged; align derivative docs via citations and summaries only. |

## Gap Prioritization

1. **Terminology Alignment:** Glossary and architecture docs require harmonized vocabulary to prevent conflicting references within the RFP.
2. **Compliance Traceability Foundations:** Existing sanity checks and RFC documents need mapping to future compliance templates; capture requirements during M1 and M3.
3. **Operational Guidance Outline:** `docs/operations/index.md` lacks structure to support submission instructions and operational expectations outlined in §13.
4. **Authoring Tool Depth:** Architecture documents need expanded detail on Authoring Tool flows to satisfy §4 and §5 narrative requirements.

## Next Steps for M0 Completion

- Validate inventory with workstream leads and tag gaps in backlog tracking spreadsheet (see project plan).
- Confirm custodians for each document and record review cadence in the project plan.
- Publish link to this inventory from `docs/index.md` once governance approves.
