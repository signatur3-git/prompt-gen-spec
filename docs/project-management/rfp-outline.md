# RPG v1.0.0.rc1 Request for Proposal Outline

This outline defines the structure of the Request for Proposal that will accompany the RPG v1.0.0.rc1 documentation package. The RFP is designed to give implementers everything needed to produce compliant tooling, with particular emphasis on the Authoring Tool. Each section identifies the guidance, evidence, and compliance criteria to be captured during the documentation effort.

## 1. Executive Summary
- Purpose of the RFP and relationship to the v1.0.0.rc1 documentation milestones.
- Summary of required deliverables (Authoring Tool documentation, implementation guides, compliance artefacts).
- Expected outcomes for implementers and reviewers.

## 2. Program Background & Source References
- Overview of the RPG initiative and references to RFC 0001, architecture briefs, and glossary.
- Documentation inventory and how it maps to RFP sections.
- Change management process for future revisions.

## 3. Documentation Deliverables Scope
- Description of all artefacts implementers must receive (guides, templates, evidence checklists).
- Versioning, formatting, and accessibility standards.
- Dependency map showing how each document supports compliance verification.

## 4. Authoring Tool Implementation Requirements
- Functional expectations for the Authoring Tool (package scaffolding, namespace validation, preview workflows).
- User experience guidelines (CLI ergonomics, UI/UX considerations, documentation snippets).
- Operational considerations (logging, telemetry opt-in, configuration management).

## 5. Authoring Tool Compliance Criteria & Evidence
- Tiered compliance requirements (Baseline, Advanced, Premium) specific to the Authoring Tool.
- Validation procedures, including required tests, sample packages, and acceptance thresholds.
- Evidence submission checklist (screenshots, command transcripts, configuration exports).

## 6. Package Validator Implementation Requirements
- Functional expectations for the Package Validator (schema enforcement, dependency checks, digital signature validation).
- Operational considerations (pipeline integration, performance thresholds, error reporting formats).
- Documentation deliverables (validation rule catalogue, configuration guides, troubleshooting flows).

## 7. Package Validator Compliance Criteria & Evidence
- Tiered compliance requirements outlining mandatory, recommended, and advanced validation behaviours.
- Required test suites, sample packages, and acceptance thresholds for validator accuracy and resilience.
- Evidence submission checklist (validation reports, benchmark summaries, exception handling logs).

## 8. Rendering Engine Implementation Requirements
- Rendering feature set (supported template types, localization support, accessibility conformance).
- Integration requirements with Authoring Tool outputs and Marketplace content feeds.
- Operational guidance (rendering performance targets, caching strategy, deployment considerations).

## 9. Rendering Engine Compliance Criteria & Evidence
- Tiered compliance requirements addressing rendering fidelity, accessibility, and performance KPIs.
- Demonstration artefacts (side-by-side reference renderings, automated accessibility test results, performance metrics).
- Evidence submission checklist (rendering scripts, configuration manifests, remediation logs).

## 10. Marketplace Implementation Requirements
- Core capabilities (package discovery, metadata search, versioning workflows, publisher onboarding).
- Security and governance expectations (publisher verification, audit logging, moderation tooling).
- User experience and documentation deliverables (marketplace navigation guides, submission walkthroughs, support models).

## 11. Marketplace Compliance Criteria & Evidence
- Tiered compliance requirements covering content curation, security controls, and user engagement metrics.
- Validation scenarios (publisher lifecycle tests, rollback exercises, moderation case studies).
- Evidence submission checklist (governance policies, analytics exports, incident response playbooks).

## 12. Compliance Framework & Traceability
- Consolidated description of compliance tiers across all components.
- Traceability matrix connecting requirements to RFC clauses, sanity checks, and validation templates.
- Instructions for recording deviations, waivers, and remediation plans.

## 13. Submission Package Instructions
- Required structure of the implementer’s response (narratives, evidence attachments, compliance matrices).
- Formatting guidelines, file naming conventions, and metadata requirements.
- Timeline for submissions, clarifications, and updates to documentation assets.

## 14. Evaluation & Review Process
- Roles and responsibilities of reviewers, including technical, compliance, and documentation leads.
- Evaluation rubric emphasising completeness, clarity, and compliance evidence.
- Feedback and resubmission procedures.

## 15. Terms, Assumptions, and Appendices
- Legal and licensing assumptions relevant to documentation reuse.
- Confidentiality and data-handling expectations for shared artefacts.
- Appendices list:
  - Appendix A: Glossary and abbreviations.
  - Appendix B: Authoring Tool evidence templates and walkthroughs.
  - Appendix C: Compliance checklists and validation scripts.
  - Appendix D: Change log and amendment history.
