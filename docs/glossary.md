| Term                        | Definition                                                                                                  |

| **Authoring Tool**          | Interface for creating and managing packages, namespaces, and domain-specific assets.                       |
| **Composite Prompt**        | A prompt assembled from multiple prompt sections, ontologies, morphers, and contextual rules.               |
| **Compliance Tier**         | Graduated level of conformance that indicates which specification requirements an implementation satisfies. |
| **Deterministic Rendering** | Guarantee that the same seed and inputs produce the same prompt output across compliant systems.            |
| **Namespace**               | Logical grouping of assets within a package. Namespaces can reference components from other namespaces.     |
| **Ontology**                | Structured representation of domain concepts and their relationships used during rendering.                 |
| **Package**                 | Distribution unit containing namespaces, assets, metadata, and dependency declarations.                     |
| **Prompt Section**          | Template-driven building block that may reference other prompt sections, producing composite prompts.       |
| **Rulebook**                | Entry point that lists root prompt sections to render and governs selection strategies.                     |
| **Separator Set**           | Collection of separators and grammatical rules for joining list-like outputs in a locale-aware manner.      |
